\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 In Section 2.1, let the user actually walk through the problem. They see a crate of boxes, draw one at random, guess the color, and then see whether they're right. Key takeaway: the user understands the structure of the crate and boxes problem.\cb1 \
\ls1\ilvl0\cb3 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 \outl0\strokewidth0 {\listtext	2.	}\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 And/or in Section 2.2, do the same as (1), but this time the user has the frequency tables to help their guessing (and maybe the user can set the frequency tables themselves). That'll get them thinking themselves about how to maximize probability of guessing correctly. Key takeaway: the user sees how what the frequency represent.\cb1 \
\ls1\ilvl0\cb3 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 \outl0\strokewidth0 {\listtext	3.	}\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 In Section 2.4, fix a decision rule and frequency tables. Draw 100 boxes uniformly at random with replacement, apply decision rule to generate prediction each time, and display running error rates (overall, among blue cube boxes, and among yellow cube boxes). In other words, make the probabilities vivid by having them show up as actual rates when you iterate the problem many times. Key takeaway: the user understands that decision rule\'a0+ frequency tables determine probabilities of interest, like error rates.\cb1 \
\ls1\ilvl0\cb3 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 \outl0\strokewidth0 {\listtext	4.	}\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 In Section 3.4, redo visualization from (1) but with faculty members, sex, tenure file, successful career. Key takeaway: user understands analogy between crates and boxes and tenure decisions.\cb1 \

\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 In Section 4, maybe for each of the four kinds of strategies have a three-panel picture: left panel a representation of general strategy, middle panel a representation of particular instance of that strategy; right panel showing the particular strategy in use (someone looking at a box, and the corresponding prediction). Key takeaway: user understands how the four strategies work.\cb1 \
\ls1\ilvl0\cb3 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 \outl0\strokewidth0 {\listtext	6.	}\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 In Section 5, maybe as in (3), but keeping track of true red, true green, false red, false green rates (overall, in blue cube boxes, and in yellow cube boxes). Key takeaway: user understands how strategy\'a0+ frequency tables determine lots of probabilities of interest, and how a confusion table represents those probabilities.\cb1 \
